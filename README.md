## Contributing

* Contributions are more than welcomed, but should follow this etiquette:

	* If you're a contributor with write access to this repository, you **should NOT** push to main branch, preferably push to a new one and *then* create the PR.
	* Keep commit titles short and then explain them in comments or preferably in the commit's description.
	* Push small commits (e.g if you changed 2 directories, commit one directory, then commit the other one and only THEN push)
